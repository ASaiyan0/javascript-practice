# Exercise 6

This is going to be a multi-part exercise to teach about classes. We're going to make a Tic Tac Toe game.

For the first part, we'll make the basic class and add the ability to set squares on the board to either X or O, as well as reset the board back to empty. The tests currently in index.spec.js are only for this part, so make sure they all pass.
