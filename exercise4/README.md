# Exercise 4

This exercise is a classic CS exercise. You will write a function that takes in a number and returns a string that's the text representation of that number. For example, if the input is 123, the output should be "one hundred twenty three". For this exercise, the input will be limited to a nunber between -999 and 999, inclusive.

You should make use of the % operator, which is modulus division. It's like normal division except that you get only the remainder. For example, 7 % 2 is 1, because 7 divided by 2 is 3 with a remainder of 1. In this exercise, it will be helpful to use % 10 and % 100 to get the individual digits.
