# Exercise 7

Alright, how about this for your next exercise. It's a classic beginner's programming project:

ToDo List

Required Features:
- Text box to add a new item to the list
- Items on the list have checkboxes you can use to complete an item
- Completed items are moved to the bottom of the list

That's all. It would teach you about html inputs and checkboxes, and it's not too bad to start from scratch for the first time (since I gave you the starter template for tic tac toe).
